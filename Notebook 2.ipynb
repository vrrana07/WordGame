First of all,\n#using multiple functions that work together to run the game was hard. I had to make certain\n#variables global, like game_type in order for each function to run without having an \n#unassigned variable. One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to make just the \n#letter in user_guess show up in word_blank and it took me many tries to sequence each character correctly.)\n\n#3.(I did end up asking my dad for help because originally, I didn't have any parameters\n#and my attempt at doing so was unnsuccessful, so he helped me make game_type global, \n#so it could be used as an arguement. He gave me a tip to make detailed variables \n#instead of just 1 letter variables.)\n\n#4.(I feel proud of my code because despite the lenth and difficulty, it was something \n#I enjoyed doing, and would do again, perhaps more complicated than this game. It feels\n#great to click run and see your code work smooth, so I'm \n#glad I chose to create this game.) \n\n\n#5.(If I had more time for this project, I would love to add some graphics and turn \n#this into a hangman sort of game where there is a visual, so that people can \n#actually have fun playing the game.)\n\n\n\nprint(\"WORD GUESS\")\nprint('INSTRUCTIONS: YOU WILL EITHER INPUT A RANDOM WORD INTO THE THE INPUT BELOW OR GENERATE A RANDOM WORD.\\nTHEN YOU OR OTHERS WILL GUESS YOUR WORD.\\nYOU WILL HAVE 5 STRIKES IF YOU GET THE WRONG LETTER.')\n\nprint(' __________                  __________' )\nprint('|  Custom  |                |   Word   |')\nprint('|   Word   |                | Generator|')\nprint('|____(A)___|                |____(B)___|')\n\ndef get_game_type(game_type):\n    \"\"\"\n\n        Takes user input for which game mode to continue in.\n\n        args:\n\n            game_type: User input for game type a or b.\n\n        returns:\n            game type code\n                1 (int): Random word generator option, continues in random_word. \n                or 2 (int): Own word input option, continues in enter_word\n\n    \"\"\"\n#Takes previous user input, game_type and uses it to determine which value to return.\n#If A is selected, 1 is returned.
